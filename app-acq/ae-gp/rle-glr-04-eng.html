          NMSO</p>
		  
        <p>The Environmental Programs required for printers offered under this series of NMSOs are excerpted from Annex A and the programs required of their Offerors are described in Annex&nbsp;B.</p>
        <h3>Annex&nbsp;A: Technical Specifications</h3>
		
        <p>1.&nbsp;Mandatory General Specifications for All Printers</p>
		
        <p>All printers, under all Groups, Categories and Sub-Categories must meet or exceed the following Mandatory General Specifications:</p>
		
        <p>All printers must:</p>
        <ol class="lower-roman">
          <li>be certified as compliant with the Canadian Electrical Code for office printers by an organization approved by the Standards Council of Canada; </li>
          <li>be certified by the manufacturer as complying with the Class A or B limits for radio noise emissions from digital apparatus set out in the Interference Causing Equipment Standard (ICES-003) of Industry Canada, or US FCC Class A&nbsp;or&nbsp;B equivalent emission limits for digital apparatus as set in the Radio Interference Regulations;</li>
          <li>be Energy Star qualified at the time of product acceptance. The vendor must ship all products with the Energy Star low-power feature activated or enabled.</li>
          <li>be manufactured in facilities that are both ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 14001 certified; and</li>
          <li>have an Environmental Ecolabeling Certification at the time of product acceptance. </li>
          <li>The printers must not prevent, through specific design features or manufacturing processes, the use of remanufactured imaging consumables, except where a licensing agreement has precluded the remanufacture. Consumables able to be remanufactured must be available for the printers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In addition, all printers in all sub-categories must be configured to print double-sided (duplex) documents as their default.</p>
        <h3>Annex B: Environmental Requirements</h3>
        <h4>1. Consumables Containers Recycling Program</h4>
        <p>(a) For all locations in Canada (except CLCA areas) where consumables containers cannot be recycled through local &quot;blue-box&quot; recycling programs, the Contractor must provide its own consumables recycling program by either: </p>
        <p>providing prepaid, postage-return packaging with the consumable when it is originally delivered, or available for download from the manufacturer's Web site; OR</p>
        <p>picking up used consumables containers at no charge.</p>
        <p>(b) Where consumables are purchased through subsequent standing offers or other purchasing instruments with provisions for Empty Cartridge Return Credit, this credit will be payable to Canada and procedures for return and pick up will be in accordance with the provisions of those standing offers.</p>
        <h4>2. Hardware Take Back and Recycling Program</h4>
        <p>The Contractor must control electronic waste through the establishment of an ongoing hardware take-back and recycling program. </p>
        <p>For a period of six (6) years from the date of the Call-up issuance, the Contractor must take back (whether or not the equipment remains in government control) any products supplied under any Call-ups (even if the Warranty Period is complete), if requested by the end user, at no charge, but is not required to pay for shipping and handling.</p>
        <p>The Contractor must recycle or dispose of all equipment taken back in an environmentally sensitive manner. At a minimum, the recycling of equipment should involve material recovery and metals recovery processes.  Facilities used to process end of life electronics must meet all applicable health, safety, environment, transport and export regulations. Facilities must possess all required permits and appropriate insurance.</p>
        <p>Acceptable processes include manual dismantling and sorting into major material categories (non-hazardous materials, electronic scrap materials, and hazardous materials) and mechanical processing for dismantling and/or material separation, with provision of dust collection and operator risk assessments and protection.</p>
        <p>Major Material categories are defined as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Non-Hazardous Materials include ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal, other metals (brass, bronze, metal fines), plastics, wood, and glass (non-leaded).</li>
          <li>Electronic Scrap Materials include cables and wires, printed circuit boards (high, medium and low grade), components, including hard drives, chips and other electronic components.</li>
          <li>Hazardous Materials include cathode ray tubes (CRT), CRT frit, leaded plasma display glass and other leaded glass, rechargeable batteries, non-rechargeable batteries, including alkaline, lead acid, and coin cell batteries on circuit boards, mercury bearing lamps and switches, components containing polychlorinated biphenyls, Ink and toner cartridges.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Electronic scrap materials and hazardous materials:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>may not be landfilled, exported to non-OECD or non-EU member countries, or processed with the use of prison labour.</li>
          <li>exporting of these materials must be done in compliance to the Export and Import of Hazardous Waste and Hazardous Recyclable Material Regulation (EIHWHRMR).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the event that it is determined by Canada that an Offeror is refusing to take back product or not recycling that product in accordance with the minimum requirements of the standing offer, Canada will arrange to have the subject material recovered and disposed off appropriately at the cost of the Offeror. In addition, the Offeror will have their standing offer deauthorized and will be excluded from holding a similar standing offer with Canada for a minimum of one year from the date of determination.</p>
        <h4>3. Packaging Take-Back and Recycling</h4>
        <ol class="lower-alpha">
          <li>All materials in which the Products are packaged and shipped must be recyclable. </li>
          <li>The Contractor must reuse, recycle or dispose of all packaging materials removed from Products delivered under any Call-up in an environmentally sensitive manner.</li>

	<h3>Part&nbsp;2</h3>
	<p>5. Environmental Considerations</p>	
	
	<p>Canada is committed to greening its supply chain. In April&nbsp;2006, Canada issued a policy directing federal departments and agencies to take the necessary steps to acquire products and services that have a lower impact on the environment than those traditionally acquired. Environmentally preferable goods and services are those that have a lesser or reduced impact on the environment over the life cycle of the good or service, when compared with competing goods or services serving the same purpose. Environmental performance considerations include, among other things: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and air contaminants; improved energy and water efficiency; reduced waste and support reuse and recycling; the use of renewable resources; reduced hazardous waste; and reduced toxic and hazardous substances. In accordance with the Policy on Green Procurement, for this solicitation:</p>
	
	<ul class="double-space">
	<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers are encouraged to offer or suggest green solutions whenever possible.</li>
	<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers are requested to provide all correspondence including (but not  limited to) documents, reports and invoices in electronic format unless  otherwise specified by the Contracting Authority or Project Authority, thereby  reducing printed material.</li>
	<li>The paper  format of the offer&nbsp;/&nbsp;arrangement should be certified as originating from a sustainable  managed forest and/or with a minimum of 30% recycled content.	  </li>
	<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers should recycle (shred) unneeded copies of non-classified/secure documents  (taking into consideration the Security Requirements).</li>

        <p>7.26	Green Procurement Initiatives</p>
		
        <p>Canada is committed to greening its supply chain. In  April 2006, Canada  issued a policy directing federal departments and agencies to take the  necessary steps to acquire products and services that have a lower impact on  the environment than those traditionally acquired.</p>
		
        <p>Environmentally  preferable goods and services are those that have a lesser or reduced impact on  the environment over the life cycle of the good or service, when compared with  competing goods or services serving the same purpose. Environmental performance  considerations include, among other things: the reduction of greenhouse gas  emissions and air contaminants; improved energy and water efficiency; reduced  waste and support reuse and recycling; the use of renewable resources; reduced  hazardous waste; and reduced toxic and hazardous substances.</p>
		
        <p>In accordance with the Policy on Green Procurement, for this solicitation:		</p>
		
		<ul class="double-space">
		<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers are encouraged to offer or suggest green solutions whenever possible.</li>
		<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers should consider the complete lifecycle of products and services  provided to favour strategies, processes, and materials that assure sustainable  development.</li>
		<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers are requested to provide all correspondence including (but not  limited to) documents, reports and invoices in electronic format unless  otherwise specified by the Contracting Authority or Project Authority, thereby  reducing printed material. If correspondence is not provided in electronic  format, double-sided printing in black and white is strongly encouraged,  whenever possible.</li>
		<li>The paper  format of the offer&nbsp;/&nbsp;arrangement should be certified as originating from a sustainable  managed forest and/or with a minimum of 30% recycled content.</li>
		<li>Offerors&nbsp;/&nbsp;suppliers should recycle (shred) unneeded copies of non-classified/secure documents  (taking into consideration the Security Requirements).</li>

        <p>13. Environmental Considerations</p>
		
		<p>The Government of Canada is committed to reducing its impact on the environment and satisfying client organization's demand for environmentally sensitive products and packaging. In addition to the direct cost reductions in an optimized imaging environment, reducing, reusing and recycling packaging and other materials can significantly cut purchasing, operating and disposal costs. Under contracts resulting from the supply arrangement, Contractors will be expected to address such criteria as:		</p>
		 
		 <ul class="double-space">
          <li>Opportunities  to reduce packaging volume and weight by reducing packaging materials used on  the products you manufacture;</li>
          <li>Opportunities  to utilize reusable shipping materials, including reusable plastic, crates, and  corrugated boxes;</li>
		  <li>Use of  recycled materials in consumable toner packaging you use; and</li>
		  <li>Use of  reduced power consumption.</li>
		 </ul>  
		  
		<p>As applicable in resulting request for proposals under the supply arrangement, the following environmental criteria from the National Master Standing Offers for printers and copiers will be used as a baseline for evaluating proposals including hardware that is recommended through consulting contracts, or installed through managed contracts.</p>  
		  
		  <ul class="double-space">
          <li>Mandatory  General Specifications for All Printers;</li>

        <p>19. Environmental Considerations</p>
		
		 <p>As of April&nbsp;2006, the Government of Canada issued a policy directing federal departments and agencies to take the necessary steps to acquire products and services that have a lower impact on the environment than those traditionally acquired. The environmental impact assessment of a product and/or service considers the whole life cycle of the product and/or service. Hence, in the near future, all government procurement will include more demanding environmental criteria to encourage product/service Offerors to improve their operations to reduce their negative impact on the environment.</p>
		 
		 <p>19.1 Environmental Properties Behaviour Recommended</p>
