					manufacturers certified under the Environmental Choice Program (ECP) or equivalent, or
					who are using fibre originating from a sustainably-managed forest certified to a
					third-party verified forest certification standard such as or equivalent to the Canadian
					Standards Association Sustainable Forest Management Standard (CSA/SFMS), the
					Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI). Canada

				<ol>
					<li>Products that are equivalent in certification to the certifications specified in the offer solicitation will be considered where the Offeror:
						<ol class="lower-alpha">
							<li>designates the certification(s) name of the product;</li>
							<li>states that the substitute certification is fully interchangeable with one of the certifications specified in the offer;</li>
							<li>provides complete specifications and descriptive literature for each substitute certification;</li>
							<li>provides compliance statements that include technical specifics showing the substitute certification meets all mandatory performance criteria that are specified in one of the certifications specified in the offer; and</li>
							<li>clearly identifies those areas in the specifications and descriptive literature that support the substitute product's compliance with any mandatory performance criteria.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Certification(s) offered as equivalent in form, fit, function and quality will not be considered if:
						<ol class="lower-alpha">
							<li>the offer fails to provide all the information requested to allow the Standing Offer Authority to fully evaluate the equivalency of each substitute certification; or</li>
							<li>the substitute certification fails to meet or exceed the mandatory performance criteria of one of the specified certifications identified in the offer.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>In conducting its evaluation of the offers, Canada may, but will have no obligation to,
						request Offerors offering a substitute certification to demonstrate, at the sole cost of
