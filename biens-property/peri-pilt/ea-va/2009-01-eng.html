              <h2>Word from the Director</h2>
              <p>Welcome to our new annual edition of <em>Valuation Adviser</em>.  Through this revised format we bring news from both sides of the Valuation and  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs Directorate (VPILT). We report on highlights  of the past year as well as on trends in our business environment and planned  initiatives for 2009.</p>
              <p>The past 12 months were busy ones for the Payments in Lieu  of Taxes (PILT) and Valuation programs. In addition to our day-to-day duties,  we have been working on the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> procedures, and launched an online version of  the Book Value Calculator. We also participated in national conferences which  allowed for knowledge and information sharing.</p>
              <p>Looking forward, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> staff will be hard at work as  many reassessments are underway across Canada. A key activity for the Valuation  Program will be to review the assessed values of buildings in which the federal  government is a major tenant. Our goal, as always, is to provide the best  possible service to our clients and ensure fair and equitable payments in lieu  of taxes across the country.</p>
              <h2 id="a1"><acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> forecasts from coast to coast</h2>
              <p>The  following provides broad forecasts of anticipated changes in federal payments  in lieu of tax (PILT) amounts for 2009-2010. We also offer summaries of factors  that may impact on <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> and property taxes next year across Canada. These  synopses are based on the best information currently available and are intended  as general guidance only.</p>
              <h3>British Columbia </h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Total <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts for British Columbia are  expected to increase by approximately 3%  in the 2009 taxation year. </p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>No single large federal initiatives are underway to impact the 2009 <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> as a whole. However, a $300 million project to build a new <acronym title="Royal Canadian Mounted Police">RCMP</acronym> division headquarters in Surrey is due to start in mid-2009. If this property turns out to be <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym>-eligible, the region's total <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> in future years (2010 or 2011) could rise by 8% to 10%, relative to 2008.</li>
              <li>Doug&nbsp;Rundell, the longtime <acronym title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</acronym> of <acronym title="British Columbia">BC</acronym> Assessment, retired in the spring of 2008. He was replaced by Connie Fair, a 15-year employee of <acronym title="British Columbia">BC</acronym> Assessment, whose most recent position was executive director of business and customer services. </li>
              <li>Some 1.8 million properties were valued for the 2008 assessment roll, an increase of <strong>1.9%</strong> from 2007. The total value was about $940 billion, a 16% increase. New construction for 2008 was estimated at $21.6 billion, 15% higher than in 2007. </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Yukon</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>In Yukon Territory, any <strong>significant <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> changes should be inventory-related</strong>. First Nations' claims settlements  leading to transfers of federal property to First Nations jurisdiction continue  to reduce the number of federal properties subject to <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym>. </p>

              <h3>Alberta</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p><acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are expected to <strong>increase by 3% to 6%</strong> for the 2009  taxation year. </p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>For the 2008 calendar year, the provincial education property tax rates were reduced by about 10.6% from 4.52 to 4.04 mills for residential and farmland property, and from 6.64 to 5.94 mills for non-residential property.</li>
              <li>Together with municipal and industry stakeholders, Alberta Municipal Affairs is reviewing the definition of farming operations. </li>
              <li>The Assessment Services Branch of Alberta Municipal Affairs has replaced the 1994 <em>Residential Cost Manual</em> with one updated to 2001. The ministry will continue to provide modifiers and cost indices for this new manual and for the 2001 <em>Metal Buildings Manual</em>, but not for the 1984 <em>Alberta Commercial Assessment Manual</em>. </li>
            </ul>
              <p>For information on Alberta's assessment and  taxation system, visit the <a href="http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/as_index.htm">Alberta Municipal  Affairs</a><a href="/comm/ai-in-eng.html#hyprlns-hyprlnk"><img src="/biens-property/images/www.gif" alt="The WWW icon indicates a link that takes you outside the federal government's common web environment." width="30" height="15" /></a> Web site.</p>
              <h3>Saskatchewan</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Total <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are expected to <strong>increase by 3% to 6%</strong> for the 2009  taxation year.</p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>The latest reassessment in Saskatchewan was completed in 2005, with June&nbsp;30, 2002, as the base date.</li>
              <li>The 2009 reassessment, which will have a base date of June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2006, will use a market value standard for residential and commercial properties, as is done in other jurisdictions in Canada. </li>
              <li>Agricultural properties will continue to be assessed using the current regulated system based on productive value. </li>
              <li>Heavy industry property, linear property (railways, pipelines) and resource production equipment will continue to be assessed according to a regulated system. </li>
              <li>The education rebate credit will still be applied in 2009. </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Manitoba</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Total <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are expected to <strong>increase by 3% to 6%</strong> for the 2009  taxation year.</p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>The 2009 tax year will conclude the current four-year assessment cycle. All properties across Manitoba were reassessed in 2006, with 2003 as the base year.</li>
              <li>The 2010 tax year will be the initial year of the next assessment cycle, with April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2008, as the base date.</li>
              <li>We expect that Manitoba will move to a regulated system of reassessing properties every two years, starting with the 2010 cycle. </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Northwest Territories</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p><acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are expected to <strong>increase by 3% to 5%</strong> for the 2009  taxation year.</p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>In 2008, the town of Hay River reassessed all land parcels as part of its general reassessment. The process will be completed in 2009 with the reassessment of all improvements to property.</li>
              <li>The General Taxation Area, which consists of hamlets, settlements and villages in the <acronym title="Northwest Territories">NWT</acronym>, has implemented a general reassessment for 2008. </li>
              <li>With the help of new technology, the <acronym title="Northwest Territories">NWT</acronym>'s assessment authority plans to shorten assessment cycles for many taxing authorities from 10-year cycles to 5-to-8-year cycles. </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Ontario </h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> and property taxes for 2009 will be based on reassessed  values, with 2008 as the base year. The coming year, 2009, is the start of a  four-year reassessment cycle. We expect Ontario's <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> to <strong>rise by 5%</strong> in 2009. </p>
              <p>High unemployment and a slump in the manufacturing  sector &ndash; particularly in the auto industry &ndash; will likely cool down Ontario's  real estate market in the near future. The real estate downturn could lead to  lower market values. </p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <ul>
              <li>Various new construction projects are underway at <acronym title="Canadian Forces Base">CFB</acronym> Trenton, Canada's largest military airport, and at <acronym title="Canadian Forces Base">CFB</acronym> Petawawa. <acronym title="Valuation and  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs Directorate">VPILT</acronym> staff will be working hard to stay abreast of these major undertakings to provide <acronym title="Department of National Defence">DND</acronym> with reliable <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> estimates.</li>
              <li>Another major project is the new border crossing at Windsor-Detroit. This initiative, which will involve all levels of government in Canada and the United States, will take a number of years to complete. It is too early to say how the project will impact on the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym>.</li>
              <li>The Ontario Assessment Review Board recently made a landmark decision that may affect how office buildings are valued in the province. The case involved some flagship properties of major financial institutions in downtown Toronto. The appellants successfully convinced the Board to ignore existing leases when placing a value on a property for assessment purposes. The decision confirms several similar cases:
                  <ul>
                  <li><em>Gander International Airport Authority v. Town of Gander</em> </li>
                  <li><em>Labatt Brewing v. City of St. John's</em> </li>
                  <li><em>Southam v. <acronym title="British Columbia">BC</acronym> Assessment Authority # 14</em> </li>
                </ul>
                  <p>It is not yet known whether the City of Toronto or the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation will appeal this decision to a higher court.</p>
                </li>
              <li>In 2008 the province set annual ceilings on  education tax rates for commercial and industrial properties. This program  should reduce the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> paid on non-residential properties, assuming all else  remains equal. </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>Quebec </h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>The Quebec real estate market grew steadily between 2004 and  2007. We can therefore expect a rise in property values of about 15% for the  municipalities that will have a new role in 2009. The overall impact on the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> should be an increase that is slightly higher than inflation. We  anticipate an inflation rate in 2009 of 1.4% and <strong>a rise in <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> of about 2%  to 2.5%</strong>.</p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <h5>Improvements to the Montreal merger </h5>
              <ul>
              <li>On June&nbsp;20,&nbsp;2008, the Quebec government passed legislation to improve how the amalgamated City of Montreal functions. The legislation is based on an agreement between the Government of Quebec, the City of Montreal and the merged municipalities.</li>
              <li>Effective January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2009, amalgamation costs will be shared by the associated municipalities according to their relative fiscal capacity. Residents will therefore receive a single municipal tax statement, which will include amalgamation expenditures. The effect of these changes will be to reduce the management costs of collecting the property tax. </li>
              <li>The associated municipalities will be able to determine the property tax-rate ceiling that applies to non-residential properties within their territory. </li>
              <li>It is too early to predict how this statute will impact on the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> in 2009. </li>

              <h3>Nunavut</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>We expect <strong>minimal <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> increases</strong> in taxation year 2009. </p>
              <p>Nunavut's assessment cycle is every 10 years, and the  latest general reassessment was completed in 2005. Over the next few years, the  only changes to assessment values will occur because of physical changes to a  property made through renovation, demolition or additions. Mill rates are the  same as in 2006; no change is foreseen for 2009.</p>
              <h3>Prince Edward Island </h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Because <acronym title="Prince Edward Island">P.E.I.</acronym> is on an annual reassessment cycle and  market values are stable, we anticipate only modest increases in assessment  values for residential and commercial properties in 2009. As a result, we  expect <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts <strong>to increase by about 2%</strong> for the 2009 taxation year.</p>

              <h3>Nova Scotia </h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Because Nova Scotia is on an annual reassessment  cycle and market values are stable, we anticipate only modest increases in  assessment values for residential and commercial properties in 2009. <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are forecast <strong>to rise by about 3%</strong> for taxation year 2009, mainly  because of tax rate changes, property value increases and the phase-out of the  business occupancy tax. </p>

              <h3>New Brunswick</h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>We expect <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts <strong>to increase by about 3%</strong> for 2009, in addition to any marginal increase because of new inventory  acquisitions and construction.

              <h3><strong>Newfoundland and Labrador</strong></h3>
              <h4><em>Forecast</em></h4>
              <p>Newfoundland introduced new assessment values in  2007, the first year of its three-year assessment cycle. No increases in  assessment values are foreseen for 2009, the third year of the cycle. We do  expect <strong>a 3% rise</strong> in the total <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> in 2009 because of tax rate changes.</p>
              <h4><em>Other developments</em></h4>
              <p>Bill C-31, an <em>Act to Amend the Assessment Act and the St. John's Assessment Act</em>, was passed on May&nbsp;26,&nbsp;2006, establishing  a &quot;special-purpose property&quot; category for assessment purposes. A property that  is designated as special purpose by the assessor must be valued according to  its reproduction cost, and only physical depreciation can be considered. The  application of this legislation to the assessments of several large  special-purpose properties in the province is being challenged before the  courts.</p>

              <h2 id="a2">Book Value Calculator goes online</h2>
              <p>Municipalities across Canada now have access to an advanced  online tool &ndash; the Book Value Calculator (BVC) &ndash; to help them modernize their  accounting systems. </p>
              <p>The <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> was developed by the staff of the Valuation  Program of Public Works and Government Services Canada and its main purpose was  to assist federal departments switch to accrual accounting in 2001. Now, local  governments throughout the country are undergoing a similar exercise to comply  with a nationwide standard that calls for accrual accounting practices by  January&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2009.</p>
              <h3><em>How the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> works</em></h3>
              <p>In the conversion to accrual-based accounting, one tries to  establish an accurate value for assets such as land, buildings and  infrastructure. This, in turn, requires determining the book value, or starting  point, of the asset and tracking costs and improvements over time. And this can  be tricky with older properties. In many cases, the original purchase price and  subsequent betterment costs are unknown. </p>
              <p>That's where the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> comes in. A sophisticated computer  modeling application, the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> allows users to estimate opening book values  quickly and with minimal effort. The tool is based on meticulously researched  benchmarks such as land values and construction costs in each part of Canada  over time. </p>
              <p>Thus, even if the user has only limited information on  the history of the asset and its current condition, the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> can calculate  original costs and deemed improvements with reasonable accuracy.</p>
              <h3><em>The word spreads</em></h3>
              <p>The <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> became known during the federal government's accrual  accounting exercise of 2001, and the word of its utility spread. </p>
              <p>Soon other organizations &ndash; notably, the Province of Ontario  (through the Ontario Realty Corporation), the Ontario Ministry of Education  (comprised of all the Province's school boards) and  the Government of Bermuda &ndash; were asking to have it made available to them. </p>
              <p>In response, Valuation Program staff members customized the  tool to take into account the specific needs of each client organization. They  supplied the program and regular updates on <acronym title="Compact Disc">CD</acronym> and also supplied training and  customer support. </p>
              <p>But when interest began to grow among municipalities, it  became clear that the Valuation Program soon would be swamped. After all, there  are about 4,000 municipalities in Canada, some with only a few assets, others  with inventories numbering in the tens of thousands of real property assets. A  more efficient way of making the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> accessible to eager users was imperative. </p>
              <p>For the past year, the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> team converted the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> into  a Web-based application and to tailor it to the needs of local governments.  This involved adding asset types commonly owned by municipalities &ndash; everything  from waste water systems to cemeteries &ndash; to the asset mix covered in the program.  The <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> team also had to update construction cost indices and land values  across Canada from 2001 data (when the indices were last revised) to current  values.</p>
              <h3><em>Online product launched</em></h3>
              <p>In June&nbsp;2008, a demonstration of the online <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> was  launched. The demo allows users to calculate the book values of up to 10 assets  free. Full use of the tool is available at a charge based on the municipality's  population (from $250 for the smallest hamlets to $50,000 for the largest  cities.) The fee is designed to recover costs only and includes provision of  regular updates, bulletins and answers to questions which are available on the  Web site.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, news of the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> is spreading internationally. The  Government of Barbados has expressed strong interest in the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> for its  upcoming modernization initiative, there have been feelers from the city of  Beijing, and hits have been registered on the Web site from about 20 countries. </p>
              <p>The <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> team is excited about the prospect of offering this  Valuation Program product to users around the world. </p>

              <h2 id="a3">Quebec appraisers hold first &quot;green&quot; conference </h2>
              <p>Some 370 participants gathered in Gatineau, Quebec, October&nbsp;16-18,&nbsp;2008, for the best-attended conference ever held by the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec</span>. The <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> is Quebec's professional association of  appraisers. </p>
              <p>A major drawing card was the emphasis on ecological issues,  says the Chief Appraiser of Canada, <acronym title="Valuation and  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs Directorate">VPILT</acronym>, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>, and one of the organizers of  the conference. </p>
              <p>&quot;Green&quot; was the theme of a number of the sessions, but also  of the conference logistics. Every aspect of the event, from food and drink to  the distribution of presentation material, was planned with green practices in  mind. Washable thermoses and mugs replaced the usual plastic water bottles and  disposable cups. Delegates received conference material on portable memory  sticks instead of on paper. Everyone was encouraged to keep energy use to a  minimum. Although delegates sometimes found it hard to break old habits, they  embraced the ecological goal with enthusiasm.</p>
              <p>One of the most popular sessions was a panel on the  challenge of valuing and certifying &quot;green&quot; buildings. Participants discussed  the difficulty of measuring the benefits of environmentally friendly  construction. For example, everyone agrees that reducing greenhouse gas  emissions is a worthwhile goal, but <em>how  much</em> should lower emissions add to the value of a building? How does one  put a price tag on eco-sensitive practices aimed at securing a broad, general  good (saving the planet), rather than delivering an immediate payback? </p>
              <p>This is a new field. Canada does not yet have any  specialists in green appraisals. A first-time course on the subject has been  developed this year at the Sauder School of Business University of British  Columbia.</p>
              <p><span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> delegates' opinions varied on the best ways to take  environmental factors into account in valuations. They also discussed the need  for meaningful certification standards. Currently, certification is piecemeal;  there is no universal standard for attesting to the &quot;greenness&quot; of a building.  Debate on these issues was lively, the one point of strong agreement being the  need to continue the discussion at future meetings. </p>
              <p>Another highlight of the conference was a presentation on  International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). These are new, more  stringent accounting standards developed to respond to a globalized business  environment and adopted by many countries. Canada will require publicly traded  companies to use <acronym title="International Financial Reporting Standards">IFRS</acronym> by 2011. Appraisal specialists will be in demand to help  with this change.</p>
              <p>The <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> conference also featured a well-received <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> session on how valuation specialists can find business opportunities with the  Government of Canada. </p>
              <p>The next <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> conference takes place in <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Trois-Rivi&egrave;res</span> in 2010.</p>

              <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> procedures standardized</h2>
              <p><acronym title="Valuation and  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs Directorate">VPILT</acronym> is streamlining its payments in lieu of taxes  operations through a new set of standardized procedures that will be available  online to staff and stakeholders across the country. </p>
              <p>The new procedures detail steps to be taken in the  following areas:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> applications (how forms must be completed and processed)</li>
              <li>Payments </li>
              <li>Late-payment supplements </li>
              <li>Unpaid tenant taxes </li>
            </ul>
              <p>Procedures for other aspects of <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> operations will be  drafted by the end of the fiscal year. The new procedures are based on the  principles laid out in the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act, 2000</em>,  and provide guidance to ensure fair and equitable <acronym title="Payments in Lieu  of Taxes">PILT</acronym> payments to  municipalities throughout Canada. </p>
              <p>&quot;We now have a 'live' document,&quot; says the  acting national manager of <acronym title="Valuation and  Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs Directorate">VPILT</acronym>'s Policy and Strategic Initiatives. The  procedures can be updated, as needed, to address new developments such as changes  in provincial legislation or technological innovations.</p>
