            <p>The Government of Canada (GC) is making &quot;greening&quot; a priority in its procurement activities. As a measure for achieving this through the Car Rental Directory, the GC would like to increase its relative usage of vehicles which are less harmful to the environment. Such vehicles would include but may not be limited to: hybrid-electric vehicles, factory-produced natural gas, propane or E-85 fueled vehicles; 4&nbsp;cylinder vehicles; ultra low-sulphur diesel fueled vehicles, and other low-emission vehicles. The Offeror should provide details on its fleet as it pertains to the bidder's environmental offering for this requirement.  The Offeror should also provide details on other environmental initiatives it is taking, including but not limited to: environmental vehicle maintenance; using environmentally-friendly vehicle cleaning products.

            <p>2.1&nbsp;Environmental Performance Considerations</p>
            <p>Canada is committed  to protecting the environment by incorporating environmentally responsible  principles and practices into its operations, and promoting environmental  stewardship by integrating environmental performance considerations into the  procurement process.</p>
            <p>In accordance with this initiative, Offerors are asked to provide,  with their offers, information regarding their use of environmentally  friendly/&quot;green&quot; practices in their service delivery. This  information will not be used in evaluation, but is for information purposes  only. </p>
            <p>Canada will use a  star rating system (0-3) to assess Offerors that can prove they are greener and  include such information into the resulting Standing Offers to provide Shippers  with the option to choose a greener service. </p>
            <p>The star rating for each Offeror will be identified in each  successful Offeror's Standing Offer. It will then be up to each Offeror to  market to Shippers their green star rating. Canada plans to identify to  Shippers the Offeror's green star rating, but it is the responsibility of  Offeror's to market any rating they may receive.</p>
            <p>The maximum total points are 32. </p>
            <ul class="double-space">
            <li>No star will be given to an Offeror if it does  not provide adequate information to this section, or it obtains zero (0) point.</li>
            <li>One (1) star will be given to an Offeror that  obtains any points up to 10&nbsp;points.</li>
            <li>Two (2) stars will be given to an Offeror that  obtains more than 10&nbsp;points and up to 20&nbsp;points. </li>
            <li>Three (3) star will  be given to an Offeror that obtains more than 20&nbsp;points and up to 32&nbsp;points.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Offerors should provide examples to demonstrate how they comply with the elements below. Canada reserves the right to verify what the Offeror claims.</p>
            <p>Elements to be considered in the rating system are, but not limited to, the following:</p>
            <ul>

This reduction will be applied to the  cost per page calculated as per <strong>1.2.1.1</strong> above and the cost per copy  including Environmental Credit will be the amount that is used in the third  step of the financial evaluation (see 1.2.1.3&nbsp;below) to determine the cost per  page threshold. (Sample provided at Annex K)</p>
            <p>To apply for the reduction, the Offeror shall complete the NSMO Optional  Standards section of Annex&nbsp;C&nbsp;-&nbsp;Model Specific Technical Specifications &amp; Standards and as proof that the facsimile has been approved for Third Party  Envirionmental Ecolabeling Certification, the offeror must submit a print-out  from the certifying body's website identifying the relevant Products as meeting  the standard. Acceptable programs are those that conform to ISO&nbsp;14024:1999,  Environmental labels and declarations, Type I environmental labeling and are  recognized by the Global Ecolabeling Network (GEN). If the proof does not  confirm that the facsimile meets the NMSO optional standards the offeror's  response to the subject optional standard will be considered to be, and  modified to read, &quot;not applicable&quot; and the percentage reduction will  not be applied.</p>
