              <h2>A word from the Director</h2>
              <p>As we enter the final quarter of the fiscal year, the Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Programs  Directorate (VPILT) can look back on some important achievements and forward to exciting new initiatives. Over the past few months, we have received most of the applications for payments in lieu of taxes from taxing authorities across the country. Our staff is working diligently to process these payments in a fair and equitable manner according to our mandate under the <em>Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act</em>. The thumbnail sketches of the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program in each region presented below gives some idea of the scope of this work. </p>
              <p>The Valuation side of the Directorate has worked equally hard to deliver its services to clients and stakeholders. The Valuation Program has responded to many requests for appraisal services in support of real estate transactions. One recent project was a comprehensive study on market values that facilitated the sale of seven major federal assets. The team has also been busy redeveloping its innovative accounting tool, the Book Value Calculator (BVC), to tailor it to the needs of Canadian municipalities that are required to have accrual accounting in place by 2010.</p>
              <p>The <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> is a computer modelling application for estimating the book value of real property assets. It was originally developed to help the federal government move to an accrual accounting regime in 2001.  Since then the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> has been in high demand, both in Canada and abroad, by other organizations seeking to modernize their accounting processes. Clients have included the Province of Ontario's realty corporation and the province's school boards. Now the Association of Municipal Managers, Clerks and Treasurers of Ontario wishes to use the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> for all municipalities in the province. This will be a large undertaking for <acronym title="Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Directorate">VPILT</acronym>, requiring the modification of the tool to accommodate different kinds of municipal assets and infrastructures as well as the training of users. The success of the project in Ontario may lead to requests for the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> from municipalities across Canada.</p>
              <p>Initiatives such as the <acronym title="Book Value Calculator">BVC</acronym> help widen the scope of our services. Through other initiatives we play a leadership role in the valuation community. For example, we are developing &quot;Green&quot; appraisal guidelines in partnership with Canada's two professional appraisal organizations. (See Valuation Advisor, January&nbsp;2007, &quot;Green valuation practices to be developed.&quot;) </p>
              <p>We are very proud of the hard work and dedication of our <acronym title="Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Directorate">VPILT</acronym> Team across the country.  Our aim, as always, is to go the extra mile.</p>

              <h2 id="a1">Environmental Scan</h2>
              <p>The following environmental scan provides broad forecasts of anticipated changes in federal payments in lieu of tax (PILT) amounts for 2008-2009 and a summary of factors that may impact on <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> and property taxes next year across Canada. These synopses are based on the best information currently available and are intended as general guidance for our federal client organizations.</p>
              <h3>National Overview</h3>
              <p>For the nation as a whole, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts are expected to rise by approximately 2 to 3% next year. Additions to inventory, new construction and renovations will raise the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> beyond the general estimated increases presented in the regional summaries.</p>

            </ul>
              <h5>Forecast</h5>
              <p>Due to probable tax-rate adjustments, economic growth and new development, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> and property tax amounts are likely to increase by 3 to 9%, in addition to any increases caused by inventory changes. </p>
              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>The strong growth of the high technology, knowledge economy, international trade and resource sectors and the boom associated with the 2010 Olympics are putting great pressure on Vancouver's office market, primarily in the downtown core.</li>
              <li>The total value of the province's 2007 assessment roll was approximately $808 billion, a 23% increase over 2006.</li>
              <li>1,783,780 properties were valued for the 2007 assessment roll, an increase of 1.9% compared to 2006.</li>
              <li>In the Yukon, any significant <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> changes will likely be inventory-related.  First Nations claims settlements leading to transfers of federal property to First Nations jurisdiction continue to reduce the number of federal properties subject to <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>. </li>

              <li>Assessment authority - Local assessors are responsible for all property assessments, except in the case of linear property, which is the responsibility of the Province of Alberta.</li>
              <li>Taxing authorities - Municipal governments</li>
              <li>Relevant legislation - <em>Municipal Government Act</em></li>

            </ul>
              <h5>Forecast</h5>
              <p>We expect <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts to rise by about 5% for taxation year 2008, mainly due to Alberta's annual inflation rate. With assessments increasing due to higher market values, municipalities are using a &quot;revenue neutral&quot; calculation to adjust the previous year's tax rate.</p>

              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>A summary report is now available on ASSET, Alberta's Internet-based, assessment-data-sharing program. The report summarizes property assessments by their property tax liability code. The <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program is investigating whether it will be possible to use ASSET as a tool for <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> purposes.</li>
              <li>The Equalized Assessment Panel (EAP), a provincially appointed technical committee, recently recommended that equalized assessments be based on each municipality's taxable assessment for the current year. The measure is designed to ensure consistency in determining municipal and school taxes. Alberta's municipal affairs ministry predicts that this will result in a higher degree of accuracy of provincial assessments and greater confidence in the system. The earliest this change is expected to take place is 2008.

              <p>The assessment cycle in Nunavut is every 10 years, and the last general reassessment was completed in 2005. Over the next few years, the only changes to assessment values will occur where there have been physical changes to a property made through renovation, demolition, or additions. Mill rates in Nunavut have not changed from 2006, and no change is foreseen for 2008.</p>

            </ul>
              <h5>Forecast</h5>
              <p>We tentatively predict an overall <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> increase of approximately 1 to 2% for the 2008 taxation year due to municipal tax-rate increases. An accurate forecast is difficult to make because of the complexity of Ontario's tax legislation. The <em>Budget Measures Act, 2004</em>,  gives municipalities various options for calculating property taxes on commercial, industrial and multi-residential properties. These options include tax caps of 5% or 10%, or caps of 5% on current-value assessments and claw-backs of tax decreases.</p>
              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>After receiving many complaints about its assessment process and after the release of a critical report by the Ontario Ombudsman in March&nbsp;2006, the Province of Ontario decided to freeze the 2006 assessed values until the end of taxation year 2008.                           	
                  The Government of Ontario is proposing the following three key changes to improve the fairness and predictability of assessments;
                  <ol>
                  <li>four-year reassessment cycles (in lieu of annual reassessments);</li>
                  <li>the phase-in of assessment increases on residential properties; </li>
                  <li>improvements/enhancements to the fairness and effectiveness of the appeal system:
                      <ul class="nobullet">
                      <li>a mandatory request for reconsideration as the first stage of the appeal process;</li>
                      <li>an appeal deadline that follows the completion of the reconsideration process,</li>
                      <li>the establishment of information disclosure requirements at both stages (request 		    for reconsideration and appeal).</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </li>
              <li><em>Ontario's Budget Measures Act</em> has changed the rules for determining tax levels on new construction. Municipalities no longer have to base their calculations on the average tax level of six comparable properties. Under the legislation, tax calculations on new construction will be based on 90% of the assessed value in 2007 and on 100% in 2008 and beyond. </li>
              <li>To enhance the province's investment climate, the Government of Ontario plans to cut the Business Education Tax (BET) by $540 million over the next seven years.  Currently, <acronym title="Business Education Tax">BET</acronym> rates across the province vary widely. The target will be a maximum education tax rate of 1.6%, which is well below the current average rate of 1.85%. </li>

            </ul>
              <h5>Forecast</h5>
              <p>We can expect incremental increases in assessed values across the province. Market-value changes point to minor increases in regions outside the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) and moderate increases within the <acronym title="Halifax Regional Municipality">HRM</acronym>. Changes within Nova Scotia's assessment authority and assessment methodology (see below) may also affect the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> in 2008.</p>
              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>Nova Scotia's assessment authority is undergoing two important changes:
                  <ol>
                  <li>It is being transformed from a line department to a municipally controlled 			not-for-profit corporation called the Property Valuation Services Corporation. As of April&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2008, the assessment authority will cease to be a provincial department, although the 		province will continue to be responsible for assessment policy and legislation. </li>
                  <li>The assessment authority has purchased a new computer-assisted mass appraisal 		system, called iasWorld. The new system is based on the Marshall Valuation Services 		calculator method and has many sophisticated features. Its introduction will impact both 		commercial and residential costed properties, which had been valued using various 		Boeckh's-based manuals.  Everyone involved is working hard to ensure the new system is 	 fully functional in time to produce the 2008 assessment roll.</li>
                </ol>
                </li>
              <li>In April&nbsp;2005, the Province of Nova Scotia enacted legislation to abolish the Business Occupancy Tax (BOT) by 2012. Business occupancy assessments will be phased out from 2006 to 2012 and completely removed from the roll for the 2013 taxation year. Municipalities are expected to raise tax rates to help offset the revenue losses caused by abolishing the <acronym title="Business Occupancy Tax">BOT</acronym>. </li>
              <li>The provincial <acronym title="Capital Asset Planning System">CAP</acronym> Program, which caps the assessed values of residential properties owned by non-commercial residents, is continuing. As of 2008, the cap rate will be tied to the <acronym title="Consumer Price Index">CPI</acronym>. The details of this initiative are included in the changes to the <em>Assessment Act</em>.</li>

              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <ul>
              <li>The Province is continuing to convert to the use of Marshall Swift Costing Manuals as its method for property assessment.

              <li>The assessed values of commercial/industrial property across New Brunswick will likely increase by about 4%, while residential values will increase marginally. </li>

            </ul>
              <h5>Forecast</h5>
              <p>Newfoundland and Labrador is in the second year of a triennial assessment cycle.  As a result, assessed values will remain the same in 2008, except for properties that have undergone physical changes. Tax rates are also expected to be stable throughout the province; therefore we expect <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> increases to be minimal.</p>
              <h5>Other developments</h5>
              <p>The government of Newfoundland and Labrador has passed new assessment legislation, which establishes a &quot;special-purpose property&quot; category for assessment purposes. Properties in this category must be valued according to their reproduction cost, plus physical depreciation; economic or functional obsolescence may not be considered in the valuation. According to the Municipal Assessment Agency Inc., examples of special-purpose property include: tank farms, refineries, airports, lighthouses, mines and quarries, smelters, transshipment facilities, marinas,wharves and hangars.</p>

              <h2 id="a3">Full steam ahead for Dispute Advisory Panel</h2>
              <p>Some 30 months into its mandate the Dispute Advisory Panel (DAP) has made significant progress in helping resolve disagreements between taxing authorities and the federal government over <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> issues. Panel members have completed hearings in three complex cases and have delivered decisions on all three to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services. Another five hearings are currently underway. At the same time <acronym title="Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Directorate">VPILT</acronym> regional staff have been seeking common ground with municipalities on a wide variety of other cases and hopefully will resolve a number of issues.</p>
              <p>The <acronym title="Dispute Advisory Panel">DAP</acronym> was appointed in May&nbsp;2005 as an impartial, independent third party to advise the Minister of PWGSC in resolving disputes involving property value, property dimension, effective rate and payment supplements that arise between PWGSC and the taxing authorities. (The Panel does not hear cases on whether a property is eligible for <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>.) In addition to its chairman, the Panel consists of 34 members who, in total, represent every province and who have been chosen for their expertise in property valuation and/or assessment and taxation law. </p>
              <p>The terms of the panel members (excluding that of the chairman which expires in June&nbsp;2008) will expire in May&nbsp;2008. The <acronym title="Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Directorate">VPILT</acronym> Directorate is seeking to re-appoint sitting members and to appoint new members to fill any vacancies. Appointments and re-appointments are made by the Governor in Council after consultation with stakeholders such as the Federation of Canadian Municipalities.</p>
              <p>The three cases the <acronym title="Dispute Advisory Panel">DAP</acronym> has heard thus far are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Rural Municipality of South Cypress<br />
                  This southern Manitoba municipality is the home of the Canadian Forces Base Shilo, which has a number of vacant buildings. Under Manitoba assessment practices, vacant properties are eligible for a reduction in assessment value (25% reduction in value for one year of vacancy; 50% reduction for two years). South Cypress requested that the vacancy allowance not be applied to these federal properties. The panel agreed with <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>'s position.</li>
              <li>Rural Municipality of Rockwood<br />
                  The federal property at issue in Rockwood (located near Winnipeg) is a group of units inhabited by Correctional Service of Canada inmates. The federal government contends these units should be treated as residential property for tax assessment purposes, while the municipality wants to consider them institutional/commercial. The panel agreed with the municipality's position.</li>
              <li>Halifax Citadel<br />
                  The municipality argues that the Citadel (the fortifications overlooking the town and harbour) should be assessed without consideration of restrictions of use that apply because of its status as a National Historic Site. The federal government contends these restrictions must be taken into account in determining the market value for tax purposes. The dispute first arose in 1997.</li>

              <p>Conferences are an important part of modern professional life but they can be hard on the environment. Think of the fossil fuels burnt to bring delegates to an event. Consider the energy consumed and waste produced by all those plastic water bottles, Styrofoam cups, reams of paper, and other throw-away items.</p>
              <p>The <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec</span>, or <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> (Quebec's association of professional appraisers) wants to help reverse the trend by making its October&nbsp;2008 conference as eco-friendly as possible. Every aspect of the <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> conference &ndash; location, meals, products, guest speakers &ndash; is being planned to have a minimal environmental impact. The 250 to 300 valuation professionals who gather at the Lac Leamy Hilton Hotel in Gatineau, Quebec, next October will have a chance not only to learn about the latest in the valuation field but also to contribute to sustainable development. </p>
              <p>The initiative has been spearheaded by an organizing committee of seven <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> members, including Andr&eacute; Morin, Chief Appraiser of Canada, <acronym title="Valuation and Payments in Lieu of Taxes Directorate">VPILT</acronym>, PWGSC. The committee is concerned about the dangers of global warming and is keen to promote green practices within the valuation community. The greening of conferences is increasingly being promoted within government and other organizations, but the concept is still new in the professional and business world. The <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr"><acronym title="Ordre des &eacute;valuateurs agr&eacute;&eacute;s du Qu&eacute;bec">OEAQ</acronym></span> conference organizing committee is working hard to ensure the October&nbsp;2008 event will be a trailblazer. Some proposed ideas for cutting waste and conserving resources at the conference include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Choice of a central location (Gatineau, Quebec) to minimize travel distances for participants.</li>
              <li>Rebates on registration fees for delegates who car-pool.</li>
              <li>Use of tap water, glasses and pitchers instead of bottled water.</li>
              <li>Meals featuring as much local food as possible (foods trucked from afar entail a high consumption of fuel). </li>
              <li>Use of china instead of Styrofoam or paper plates and cups.</li>
              <li>Reducing paper by offering conference presentations on portable memory sticks.</li>
              <li>Use of recycled paper and other products.</li>
              <li>Encouraging delegates to reduce, re-use and recycle.</li>
              <li>Turning off lights and machines when not in use. </li>
              <li>Inviting guest speakers from Quebec's and Canada's environmental movements.</li>
              <li>Workshop sessions on green valuation and information on green buildings.</li>
            </ul>
              <p>All these measures will reduce the conference's environmental &quot;footprint&quot; and save money too by cutting down on waste and consumption of energy. Delegates will become more aware of what individuals and groups can do to protect our environment. Important too will be the leadership example shown to other organizations.</p>
              <p>The organizers are well aware that one eco-friendly conference is just a small step in the battle against global warming. But small steps can lead to more steps and to the proliferation of  grassroots action. Such action on many fronts will be needed to keep the earth hospitable for future generations.</p>
