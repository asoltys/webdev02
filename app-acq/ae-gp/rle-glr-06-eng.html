				<h3>Annex&nbsp;&quot;G&quot;</h3>
				<p>Green Procurement Baseline Questionnaire</p>
				<h4>Purpose</h4>
				<p>The purpose of this document is to assist the Government of Canada (GC) in understanding the Paper industry's progress in greening its supply chain and operations.</p>
				<h4>Context</h4>
				<p>The federal government is committed to greening its supply chain. As of April&nbsp;2006, the GC's Policy on Green Procurement took effect, requiring all federal departments and agencies to take the necessary steps to incorporate environmental considerations into the procurement process. Environmental considerations with goods or services address environmental considerations associated with the whole life cycle of the product or service, from the extraction of the raw material, through acquisition and use by customers as well as the process by which it is disposed once it is no longer required.</p>
				<p>One of the avenues for greening the government procurement is through the greening of procurement instruments used in commodity management.</p>
				<p>At this time, Public Works and Government Service Canada (PWGSC) wants to understand how the industry has progressed in incorporating environmental considerations into its goods and services. Upcoming requests for proposal (RFP) will require that suppliers meet certain mandatory environmental criteria. While adding new environmental criteria, <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> needs to ensure that there is still enough competition amongst potential suppliers to obtain a fair price for the requested goods and services. It is therefore necessary for <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> to understand the current state of the industry, relative to environmental factors, in order to successfully incorporate mandatory environmental criteria without inappropriately limiting competition.</p>
				<p>In the future, it is anticipated that environmental criteria will become more demanding as the GC will encourage suppliers to improve the environmental performance of their goods and services and mitigate negative environmental factors.</p>
				<h4>Questionnaire</h4>
				<p>Please fill out the questionnaire on the next page and return it with your submission.</p>

					<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL ATTRIBUTES</h3>
					
				<p>As part of the federal governments commitment to environmentally responsible procurement,  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>  encourages the private sector to develop and implement environmentally responsible initiatives in manufacturing processes, products, business management systems and packaging.</p>
				<p>In addition to completing Annex&nbsp;&quot;F&quot;, Bidders are requested to submit information and /or substantiating documentation regarding their stated environmental initiatives, and the details of the environmental impact of the goods proposed in terms of overall environmental management, for example:</p>
				
				<ol class="lower-alpha">
				<li>Provide details of  your policies and practices in relation to environmentally responsible manufacturing  processes.</li>
				<li>Provide details of your policies and  practices in relation to environmentally responsible  waste disposal initiatives</li>
				<li>Provide details of your policies and  practices in relation to waste reduction initiatives</li>
				<li>Provide details of your policies and  practices in relation to packaging initiatives</li>
				<li>Provide details of your policies and  practices in relation to re-use strategies.</li>
				<li>Provide details of  your policies and practices in relation to recycling</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>Your firm  is requested to complete Table&nbsp;1 &ndash; Recycled Content of Source Materials,  identifying all major materials applicable to the products offered by your firm  against this standing offer and their respective recycled content. The  materials listed in the table are a representative sampling only. </p>				
				
				<p>Your firm  is requested to complete Table&nbsp;2&nbsp;-&nbsp;Recycled Content of Packaging Components,  identifying all components applicable to the packaging required for the products  offered by your firm against this standing offer and their respective recycled  content.&nbsp; An example of a completed table  is provided for your information.</p>
				<p>If your firm has a corporate environmental  policy, you must submit a copy of this policy either on corporate letterhead,  as corporate documentation or provide your firms web site address where this  information resides. In support of your firm's environmental policy you must  provide documentation regarding the environmental principles referenced in your  policy and details of the environmental policy and its impact in terms of  overall environmental management.</p>
				
				<p>If your facility has established a program for solid waste auditing, has prepared a waste reduction plan and has instituted a means to track progress towards waste reduction and diversion from disposal of materials such as metals, plastics, fabrics, wood, fibreglass, glass etc., a description of this program and or a copy of the most recent waste audit shall be submitted.</p>

				<p>Awaiting relevant information from commodity team</p>
				<p>Annex D<br />
					Green Procurement Questionnaire<br />
					(Rev: 22&nbsp;September&nbsp;2008)</p>
				<h3>Purpose</h3>
				<p>The purpose of this questionnaire is to assist Canada in understanding the industry's progress in greening its supply chain and operations.</p>
				<h3>Context</h3>
				<p>Canada is committed to greening its supply chain. In April&nbsp;2006, Canada issued a policy directing federal departments and agencies to take the necessary steps to acquire products and services that have a lower impact on the environment than those traditionally acquired. Assessing the environmental impact of a product or service involves considering the whole life cycle of the product or service, from the extraction of the raw material to its disposition at the end of its useful life.</p>
				<p>PWGSC wants to understand how the industry has progressed in greening its own supply chain and operations and the goods and services it provides. Upcoming bid solicitations may include evaluation criteria (either mandatory or rated) or contractual requirements related to the environment and  <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym>  is currently gathering information so that it can consider appropriate environmental evaluation criteria and/or contractual requirements for future procurements.</p>
				<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
				<p>Please fill out the questionnaire on the following pages and return it with your bid.</p>
				<p>Note:  It is recognized that this procurement is mostly for a service but there will also be products used in the delivery of this service.  The questions relating to material or products target the cabling products and associated hardware required by the Bidder to deliver the service.  The Bidder should respond with corporate policy and practices or from knowledge of industry's and manufacturers' policies and practices. </p>
