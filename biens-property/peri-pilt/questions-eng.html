              <h2 id="no1">1. Why doesn't the Government of Canada pay property taxes on the property it owns?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> Under Section 125 of the <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-4.html"><em>Constitution Act, 1867</em></a>, the Government of Canada is exempt from paying any taxes levied by local and provincial levels of government of which property taxes are an example. However, the Government of Canada does make payments in lieu of property taxes to local governments.</p>
              <h2 id="no2">2. Why does the Government of Canada make payments in lieu of property taxes?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> The Government  of Canada  makes payments in lieu of taxes to recognize the services it receives from municipal  governments and to pay its share of the costs to municipalities where federal  property is located. However,  in light of the federal government's constitutional exemption from taxation,  these payments are made at the discretion of the Minister of Public Works and  Government Services or the Heads of Crown corporations and agencies.</p>
              <h2 id="no3">3. How many kinds of <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> are there? How is each calculated?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> There are five kinds of charges against real property for which payments in lieu are made: </p>
              <ol>
              <li>Payments       in lieu of real property taxes  are       the product of the federal property value multiplied by the effective tax       rate plus any mitigation measures and is paid on an annual basis. </li>
              <li>Payments       in lieu of frontage or area charges  are       similar to improvements and betterment charges, for instance, the       installation or repair of sanitary and storm sewers or street lighting. The <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> is        calculated by multiplying an       applicable rate by a dimension of the property, such as the frontage or       area. The total eligible cost for the improvement is calculated and then       billed either as a one-time payment, or debentured and billed in annual       instalments. </li>
              <li>Payments       in lieu of service charges can be made  for       municipal services not included in the tax rate, like unmetered water or       garbage collection.   To be eligible, the fee   must       be set as annual flat rate charge  and  the service must be provided to       all property in a particular class, billed to the property owner and not       dependent on consumption. </li>
              <li>Late Payment  Supplements  can be  made  to compensate taxing authorities when payments in lieu of real property taxes,  frontage or area charges and service charges are unreasonably delayed. They are  calculated by applying the lesser of either the taxing authority's late payment  rate or the rate set by the <em>Financial  Administration Act</em>, to the amount of the payment that is late, over  the period for which it is late, plus 15&nbsp;days for processing and mailing. </li>
              <li>Payments       in lieu of business occupancy tax (where applicable) can be paid       by Crown corporations listed in Schedule IV of the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em> against their property held as an agent of the Crown. Business occupancy       taxes are usually calculated as a percentage of the real property tax,       depending on the type of business. </li>
            </ol>
              <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" width="19" height="12" alt="" /><br />
                Top of Page</a> </div>
              <h2 id="no4">4. Where do the funds to pay the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> come from?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> For  all federal  departmental property, the  payments  are made by Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC), as it is the  common service provider for all aspects of the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program  and the  Minister  of <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services">PWGS</acronym> is responsible to administer the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em>. However, each federal department   is responsible for the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> liability on its properties as they receive <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> funding as part of their annual departmental budgets provided by Treasury  Board. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is signed between <acronym title="Public Works and Government Services Canada">PWGSC</acronym> (<acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program) and each federal  department. The <acronym title="Memorandum of Understanding">MOU</acronym> details  the roles  and responsibilities as well as the financial  arrangements  regarding  the payment and  reimbursement of  funds  expended as payments in lieu of taxes. </p>
              <h2 id="no5">5. Why was the name of the payment changed from grant to <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> is the acronym for &quot;payment in lieu of taxes.&quot; It is a relatively new term used to describe what was previously known as a &quot;grant in lieu of taxes&quot; or GILT, which had been authorized under the <em>Municipal Grants Act, 1980</em>. As part of the Minister's modernization initiative of the Municipal Grants program, which begun in the late 1990s, the name of the Act was changed to the <em>Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act</em> and the acronym became <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>. These changes were originally suggested by the <a href="http://www.fcm.ca/home.htm">Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM)</a>&nbsp;<a href="/comm/ai-in-eng.html#hyprlns-hyprlnk"><img src="/biens-property/images/www.gif" alt="The WWW icon indicates a link that takes you outside the federal government's common web environment." width="30" height="15" /></a> whose members believed that using the term &quot;grant&quot; for the payments made in lieu of property taxes did not reflect the value of the services provided by municipal levels of government to federal properties. Using &quot;payments&quot; rather than &quot;grants&quot; put the emphasis on the government's responsibility as a property owner to share in  the cost of local government, rather than its generosity in making a payment which they are not legally obliged to make. </p>
              <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" width="19" height="12" alt="" /><br />
                Top of Page</a> </div>
              <h2 id="no6">6. How are the values used for calculating <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> set for federal property? </h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> In Canada,  the setting of property assessed  values for property tax purposes  is  typically the responsibility of the provincial or municipal levels of  government. However, under the <em>Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act</em>, the  class and value to be applied to federal property for the calculation of <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> is  the value that,  in the opinion of the Minister of  Public Works and Government Services, would  be attributable   if the property were taxable  property.  In addition, the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em> does establish slight  differences between private taxable property improvements and federal  improvements that are subject to <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>. For example, the runway surfaces at  federal airports are improvements that are specifically excluded under the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em>, but are assessable and taxable  at privately owned airports. Therefore the eligibility, class and value used to  calculate the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> on federal property is established by the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program  within the context of both provincial    assessment legislation and procedures, and the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em> and its regulations. </p>
              <h2 id="no7">7. Does the federal government set the tax rates?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> No,  the tax rates  are set by the  taxing authorities, according to municipal and  provincial legislation. Once the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program  determines the    property or tax class that would  apply to  the federal  property, if it was  taxable, the tax rates consistent for that class are used  to calculate the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym>.</p>
              <h2 id="no8">8. Why is <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> not paid for third party tenants in Crown properties?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> Under the <em>Payments in Lieu of Taxes Act</em>, federal property - either occupied or vacant - is only eligible for <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> when it is under the administration and control of a Minister of the Crown. Therefore, when the Crown grants an interest in its real property, such as a lease, to a third party occupant, it ceases to be federal property under the <em><acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Act</em> therefore,  no <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> can be paid. </p>
              <h2 id="no9">9. Are there any exceptions where <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> may be paid for third party tenants in Crown properties?</h2>
              <p><strong>A. </strong>Yes, agreements  with third party tenants or other occupants  of less than one year     would  be considered federal property and thus <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> eligible. Another situation where a <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> may be paid on property leased to a third party tenant is when the federal government acquires property from the private sector that has existing leases. The federal government would respect the fact that under those existing leases the landlord would pay the property taxes to the taxing authority and collect the tenant's share of the taxes as part of the rent. Therefore, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> would be paid on those leases until they expire and once renegotiated, that tenant would be responsible for the taxes and that space would no longer be <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> eligible.</p>
              <h2 id="no10">10. Do third party tenants in Crown properties have to pay property taxes on the space they occupy?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> Under the <em>Constitution Act</em>, federal property is always exempt from taxation. However, if occupied by a third party, the property is not eligible for a payment in lieu of taxes unless the period of the tenancy is for less than one year or if it was a lease that existed when the property was acquired by the federal government. Under prevailing assessment legislation, assessors are generally required to assess tenant-occupied Crown property as if it were owned by the tenant. Furthermore, the legislation governing realty taxing authorities gives them the right to tax the tenant's interest and the billing and collecting of the tenant's taxes must be a direct interaction between the taxing authority and the tenant. </p>
              <div class="topPage"> <a href="#tphp" title="Return to Top of Page"><img src="/clf20/images/tphp.gif" width="19" height="12" alt="" /><br />
                Top of Page</a> </div>
              <h2 id="no11">11. What happens if third party tenants in Crown properties default on their property taxes?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> When the owners of private property do not pay their property taxes, eventually the taxing authority has the right to register a property for sale to recover unpaid taxes. However, since federal property is exempt from taxation, it cannot be registered for tax sale under any circumstance. Therefore, if third party tenants in Crown property do not pay their taxes, the taxing authority must take other means to recover the taxes. Generally, this involves going to court and obtaining judgment against the tenant. In many instances, taxing authorities have never been able to recoup the loss. </p>
              <p>This situation changed beginning with the 2000 tax year, as the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes"><em>PILT</em></acronym><em> Act</em> includes a provision for the taxing authority to request a payment in lieu of taxes on that portion of the federal property occupied by the defaulted tenant, after it demonstrates that every reasonable attempt has been made to collect the taxes from the tenant without success. </p>
              <h2 id="no12">12. Does the federal government pay property taxes or <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> on property leased from the private sector?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> The federal government pays rent to landlords for property or space leased on behalf of federal departments but the landlords, alone, are responsible for paying all property taxes on their property. The federal government cannot pay property taxes directly, as it is <em>constitutionally</em> exempt from taxation. Therefore, the landlord must contract for sufficient rent and recoveries to cover any costs associated with real property taxes on federally occupied property.</p>
              <h2 id="no13">13. Does the federal government pay <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> on property
              leased from other tax exempt bodies, like a province?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> Property leased from a province is <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> eligible. However, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> cannot be paid on property leased from a municipality, other exempt bodies or private concerns. Also, if the federal government owns a building which is located on land leased from a province, <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> is payable on both the land and the building. However, if a federal building is located on land owned by a municipality or another exempt body, only the federally owned building would be <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> eligible, the land would not.</p>
              <h2 id="no14">14. What can a federal department do to ensure <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> are correct on its properties?</h2>
              <p><strong>A.</strong> There are several areas where federal departments can assist the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program directly:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Provide the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program by January&nbsp;31<sup>st</sup> of each year, with any realty asset capital plans or multi-year plans, detailing planned changes to the portfolio that could influence value or <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts.</li>
              <li>Inform them as soon as possible when property changes, either planned or unplanned, are implemented. Relevant changes would include:
                  <ul>
                  <li>major renovations or additions </li>
                  <li>changes to the areas and   dates  of tenants in third party  occupancies in federal property </li>
                  <li>long-term vacancies</li>
                  <li>construction of new buildings </li>
                  <li>demolitions </li>
                  <li>acquisition of property</li>
                  <li>pending or completed property disposals or transfers between departments </li>
                  <li>land severance </li>
                  <li>significant change of use</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
              <li>With reasonable notice, provide access for <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> staff to conduct physical inspections of any property so that the nature and quality of improvements affecting value can be confirmed.</li>
              <li>Advise members of the <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> Program of all servicing issues that may have an impact on <acronym title="Payments in Lieu of Taxes">PILT</acronym> amounts. For example, when a municipality cannot or will not provide the same level of services that they normally provide to similar taxable property.</li>
              <li>Ensure that the relevant taxing and assessment authorities are informed of all third-party occupancies that will exceed one year, then monitor and confirm that these tenants pay any real property taxes levied in respect to their occupancies.</li>
            </ul>
