				<p>A.2.3 Environmental Criteria for Printing Inks:</p>
				<p>In order to reduce the environmental impact of its print publishing activities, the Government of Canada chooses to use inks that are considered environmentally friendly, containing vegetable oil-based materials. The printing inks used in contracts awarded under this Supply Arrangement will adhere to the following criteria for % of vegetable oils as well as the % of VOC within the ingredients composing the ink.</p>
				<p>A.2.3.1 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) Criteria:</p>
				<p>The common VOC in a conventional lithographic printing ink is high-boiling aliphatic petroleum distillate. This distillate is used to dissolve the resins that will eventually bind to the substrate during printing. The amount of ink VOC that is released to the atmosphere depends on the process; heatset inks release 80% of their VOCs while sheetfed inks release only 5%. VOC in an environmentally friendlier ink would be below 18 wt% for sheetfed inks, below 30% for sheetfed varnishes, and below 40&nbsp;wt% for heatset inks and heatset overprint varnishes.</p>
				<p>A.2.5 Papers:</p>
				<p>Whenever possible,  the Government of Canada uses only paper stocks considered to be  environmentally friendly. Selection of these papers is based on factors such as  sustainable development, life-cycle management and/or forest management. For  this Supply Arrangement, only papers from manufacturers  certified under the Environmental Choice Program (ECP), or who are using fibre  originating from a sustainably-managed forest certified to a third-party  verified forest certification standard such as the Forestry Stewardship Council  (FSC), Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) or the Canadian Standards  Association Sustainable Forest Management Standard (CSA/SFMS) will be  acceptable for completion of the work. Paper specifications for each project  will be provided to bidders in the RFP during the process for selecting a  Supplier. Should a RFP specify a paper brand name that does not meet the  environmental criteria stated above, bidders will:</p>
				<p>so inform the contracting authority for the  RFP<br />
			    suggest an alternative paper, having  equivalent specifications, that meets the criteria. The RFP Contracting  Authority will inform the Contractor in writing of their approval of the  suggested alternative paper or of their decision not to change from the originally  specified paper.</p>
